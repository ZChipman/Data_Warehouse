# Data_Warehouse

##  Backgorund
Created a data warehouse, integrating data from two external data sources (a fictitious retail database and a fictious film streaming database). Files in this repository include the project charter, High-Level/Detailed Dimensional Model plans, the ROLAP SQL script, and the Power BI visuals created. 

ETL documentation was not included due to it being too large to upload. However, screenshots of the ETL process can be found in the PowerPoint presentation.
