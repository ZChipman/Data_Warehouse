##  Backgorund

Built a a BI solution from scratch for a ficticiuos conglomerate (Fundgemart, Inc.) that is subject oriented, non-volatile, time variant, and seamlessly integrated:

1. Fudgemart - An online retailer. The database consists of customers, products and vendors.

2. Fudgeflix - An online DVD by mail and video on demand service, similar to Netflix. The database contains concepts such as accounts, subscriptions and video titles.

A third external database was also provided that included customer tweets and survey responses regarding company products.

This project was a collaboration between myself, Andrew Dobkowski, Kevin Hager, Jennifor Han, and Alison Reikher.
