##  Backgorund

Built a BI solution from scratch for a ficticious conglomerate (Fundgemart, Inc.) with two subsidiaries:

1. Fudgemart - An online retailer. The database consists of customers, products, and vendors.

2. Fudgeflix - An online DVD by mail and video on demand service, similar to Netflix. The database contains concepts such as accounts, subscriptions, and video titles.

A third external database was also provided that included customer tweets and survey responses regarding company products.

My team, overseen by Humayun Khan (https://www.linkedin.com/in/hhkhan/) was tasked with building the Customer Feedback portion of the Data Warehouse. The team consisted of myself, Andrew Dobkowski (https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewdobkowski/), Kevin Hager (https://www.linkedin.com/in/-kevin-hager/), Jennifer Han (https://www.linkedin.com/in/jennifer-han-15602281/), and Alison Reikher (https://www.linkedin.com/in/alison-reikher/).

I will summarize the contents of the files listed below and detailed how they affected the design of the Data Warehouse.

### Business Requirements:

For any business to have lasting success they must be focused on data. Fudgemart is no exception to this, which is why they are seeking to improve their current data bases. Fudgemart is wanting to create a data warehouse in order to enable the integration of their two currently separated data bases, Fudgemart and Fudgeflix. They want to be able to use their data to its fullest potential by guaranteeing that it is compatible with business intelligence tools, as well as ensuring that their newly created data warehouse is subject-orientated, non-volatile, integrated, and time-variant.
